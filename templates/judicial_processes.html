        <h2>Understanding Legislative Systems</h2>
        <p>Governments across the world operate through a variety of systems, each designed to address specific societal needs and cultural contexts. Below are some of the primary systems of governance:</p>

        <h3>Key Judicial Systems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Democracy:</strong> A system of government where power resides with the people, who exercise their power directly or through elected representatives.</li>
            <li><strong>Republic:</strong> A form of democracy where the country is considered a "public matter" and is governed by elected officials according to the rule of law.</li>
            <li><strong>Monarchy:</strong> A system led by a king or queen, with power that may be absolute or constitutional, depending on the country's laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Authoritarianism:</strong> A system where power is concentrated in the hands of a single leader or a small group, often with limited political freedoms for citizens.</li>
            <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> A system where power is divided between a central authority and various constituent regions or states.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Government Systems Matter</h3>
        <p>Understanding different government systems helps us appreciate the diversity of political structures around the world and the principles underlying them. It also informs citizens about their rights and responsibilities within their own systems.</p>
